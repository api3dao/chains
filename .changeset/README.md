# Using Changeset in API3 Packages update

## Package update

Run the following command to update the package:

```bash
yarn changeset
```

Then follow the instructions in the terminal:

```bash
🦋  What kind of change is this for chains? (current version is x.x.x)
❯ patch
  minor
  major
```

```bash
🦋  Please enter a summary for this change (this will be in the changelogs).
🦋    (submit empty line to open external editor)
🦋  Summary ›  [CHANGES]
```

After that, you will be asked to confirm the changeset:

```bash
🦋  Summary › [CHANGES]
🦋
🦋  === Summary of changesets ===
🦋  patch:  chains
🦋
🦋  Is this your desired changeset? (Y/n) › true
```

If you confirm, the changeset will be created and you will be asked to publish it:

```bash
🦋  Changeset added! - you can now commit it
🦋
🦋  If you want to modify or expand on the changeset summary, you can find it here
🦋  info .changeset/[MD_FILE]
✨  Done.
```

Commit the changeset and push it to the repository:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "chore: update chains"
git push
```

Merge the changeset to the main branch:

```bash
git checkout main
git merge [BRANCH_NAME]
git push
```

To publish the package, merge main to the `production` branch:

```bash
git checkout production
git merge main
git push
```

Changeset will raise a PR to the `production` branch. After the PR is merged, the package will be published to npm.

Following the publish `changeset` will update the `CHANGELOG.md` and `package.json` files in `production` branch.

Merge the `production` branch to the `main` branch to keep the `main` branch up to date.
