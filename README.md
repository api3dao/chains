The single source of truth for chain-related information across API3 projects
</h4>

## üì¶ Installation

```sh
npm install @phase21/chains --save
yarn add @phase21/chains
pnpm add @phase21/chains
```

## üìñ API

The following variables/functions are exported from this package

### CHAINS

The single source of truth for the list of supported chains.
A static array of `Chain` objects.

```ts
import { CHAINS } from '@phase21/chains';
console.log(CHAINS);
/*
[
  {
    name: 'Arbitrum testnet',
    alias: 'arbitrum-goerli-testnet',
    id: '421613',
    ...
  },
  ...
]
*/
```

### hardhatConfig.networks()

Returns an object where the key is each chain's alias and the value is an object that can be used as the `networks` field of [`hardhat.config.js`](https://hardhat.org/hardhat-runner/docs/config).

The default `url` values can be overridden with chain specific environment variables. These environment variables take the form of `HARDHAT_HTTP_RPC_URL_${toUpperSnakeCase(chain.alias)}`. e.g. `HARDHAT_HTTP_RPC_URL_ARBITRUM_GOERLI_TESTNET`.

```ts
import { hardhatConfig } from '@phase21/chains';
console.log(hardhatConfig.networks());
/*
{
  "arbitrum-goerli-testnet": {
      accounts: { mnemonic: '' },
      chainId: '421613',
      url: 'https://...',
  },
  ...
}
*/
```

### hardhatConfig.etherscan()

Returns an object where the key is each chain's alias and the value is an object that can be used as the `etherscan` field of [`hardhat.config.js`](https://hardhat.org/hardhat-runner/docs/config) (requires the [`hardhat-etherscan` plugin](https://hardhat.org/hardhat-runner/plugins/nomiclabs-hardhat-etherscan)).

NOTE: [hardhat-etherscan](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@nomiclabs/hardhat-etherscan) requires us to use a dummy API key with Blockscout block explorer APIs. We use "DUMMY_VALUE" but it could have been anything else.

```ts
import { hardhatConfig } from '@phase21/chains';
console.log(hardhatConfig.etherscan());
/*
{
  apiKey: {
    'arbitrumGoerli': { ... }
  },
  customChains: [
    ...
  ]
}
*/
```

### hardhatConfig.getEnvVariableNames()

Returns an array of expected environment variable names for chains that have an API key required for the explorer. The array also includes a single `MNEMONIC` variable that can be used to configure all networks.

NOTE: Each `ETHERSCAN_API_KEY_` and `HARDHAT_HTTP_RPC_URL_` environment variable has the chain alias as a suffix, where the alias has been converted to upper snake case.

```ts
import { hardhatConfig } from '@phase21/chains';
console.log(hardhatConfig.getEnvVariableNames());
/*
[
  'MNEMONIC',
  'ETHERSCAN_API_KEY_ARBITRUM_GOERLI_TESTNET',
  ...
  'HARDHAT_HTTP_RPC_URL_ARBITRUM_GOERLI_TESTNET',
  ...
]
*/
```

### viemConfig.chains()

Returns an array of chains in the format that [Viem](https://viem.sh/docs/chains/introduction) expects. Each Chain object can be used to [create a Viem public client](https://viem.sh/docs/clients/public#usage).

Additional `rpcUrls` values can (optionally) be added through the use of environment variables. These environment variables take the form of `API3_CHAINS_HTTP_RPC_URL_${toUpperSnakeCase(chain.alias)}`. If a matching environment variable is detected for a given chain, then it will be added to the `http` array of the `rpcUrls.environment` object. If no matching environment variable is detected, then the `http` array is left empty.

```ts
import { viemConfig } from '@phase21/chains';
console.log(viemConfig.chains());
/*
[
  {
    id: 421613,
    name: 'arbitrum-goerli-testnet',
    network: 'arbitrum-goerli-testnet',
    rpcUrls: { default: ..., public: ..., environment: ... }
    ...
  },
  ...
]
*/
```

### Types

Types are also exported and can be found in `src/types.ts`.
Types are generated from [zod](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod) schemas.
These schemas are also used to validate each chain.

## üìÑ Scripts

The following utility scripts are available

### generate:chains

Generates the latest `CHAINS` array and outputs the file to `src/generated/chains.ts`

```sh
yarn generate:chains
```

### providers:ping

Iterates through the list of chains to check that the chain is configured correctly and is responsive.

```sh
yarn providers:ping
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Development

The most common type of change would be adding or updating a chain. This can be done by creating or editing the relevant JSON file in the `chains/` directory.

If any changes are made to chains, you will need to "regenerate" the chains. This will compile all of the JSON files into a single TypeScript file for projects to import. This can be done with the following command

```sh
yarn generate:chains
```

The list of TypeScript chains is also validated against all of the list of JSON files to ensure that everything is in sync.

NOTE: You will not be able to push changes to chains without having regenerated the TypeScript chains.

### Validation

Validations can be run with the following commands.

```sh
# Validate each chain JSON file conforms to the zod schemas
yarn validate:chains

# Run all validations
yarn validate
```

## Package update

Run the following command to update the package:

```bash
yarn changeset
```

Then follow the instructions in the terminal:

```bash
ü¶ã  What kind of change is this for chains? (current version is x.x.x)
‚ùØ patch
  minor
  major
```

```bash
ü¶ã  Please enter a summary for this change (this will be in the changelogs).
ü¶ã    (submit empty line to open external editor)
ü¶ã  Summary ‚Ä∫  [CHANGES]
```

After that, you will be asked to confirm the changeset:

```bash
ü¶ã  Summary ‚Ä∫ [CHANGES]
ü¶ã
ü¶ã  === Summary of changesets ===
ü¶ã  patch:  chains
ü¶ã
ü¶ã  Is this your desired changeset? (Y/n) ‚Ä∫ true
```

If you confirm, the changeset will be created and you will be asked to publish it:

```bash
ü¶ã  Changeset added! - you can now commit it
ü¶ã
ü¶ã  If you want to modify or expand on the changeset summary, you can find it here
ü¶ã  info .changeset/[MD_FILE]
‚ú®  Done.
```

Commit the changeset and push it to the repository:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "chore: update chains"
git push
```

Merge the changeset to the main branch:

```bash
git checkout main
git merge [BRANCH_NAME]
git push
```

To publish the package, merge main to the `production` branch:

```bash
git checkout production
git merge main
git push
```

Changeset will raise a PR to the `production` branch. After the PR is merged, the package will be published to npm.
